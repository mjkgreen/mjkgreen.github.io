	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I am a recent Engineering Physics graduate with a focus on mechanical engineering.
          I'm interested in astrophysics, teaching, research, and process optimization. I have gained experience 
          in these fields through tutoring, outreach, design teams, research through the McDonald Institute,
          and experience as a teaching assistant. I am currently doing a Masters of Aerospace Engineering so that 
	  I can contribute to the emerging industry. </p>
